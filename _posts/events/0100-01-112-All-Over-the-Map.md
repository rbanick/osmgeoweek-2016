All Over the Map! is sponsoring our first Mapathon of the year for GIS Day! 
On November 16, come out to the CGA from 7pm-10pm to map part of Kenya on OpenStreetMap 
in support of the President's Malaria Initiative! There will be pizza, fun music, and 
great instruction for those who have never mapped before! It's sure to be a blast! 

Note: The CGA (Center for Geospatial Analysis) is on the second floor of Swem Library!
