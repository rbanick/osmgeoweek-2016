This event has a double purpose: to introduce OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the humanitarian mapathon to the 
beginners and to perform some humanitarian mapping together on one or more tasks agreed with HOT and 
Missing Maps; and to have a discussion about the formation and structure of the new chapter of 
YouthMappers at Politecnico di Milano. Join us for a great event!
