Open Humanitarians, in collaboration with Kinnaird College for Women University, is celebrating OSM GeoWeek 2016 with a 
mapathon in a womenâ€™s only university. Attendees of this mapathon will get training on what is mapping, how can you 
map and how to be a part of the global humanitarian community.
