Students at the University of Edinburgh will be meeting on campus to learn how to use OSM, 
the role of humanitarian mapping and OSM communities, and map for a few hours.  
Edinburgh has students from all over the world, and students will be able to bring their 
new knowledge of OSM back to their home communities.
