HOT mapping event with the theme "kaljaa ja kartoitusta - darraa ja digitointia". 
We meet at Bruuveri Pub in Kamppi (Helsinki) at 18.00 and continue until the last one of us leaves (or the pub closes).   
Come, bring your laptop, a mouse and good spirits. The event is beginner-friendly; we introduce anyone new to HOT and Missing Maps!
