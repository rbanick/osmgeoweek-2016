Open Humanitarians, in collaboration with the Geographical Society at Forman Christian College (a chartered university), 
are celebrating OSM GeoWeek 2016 and the GIS Day with a Geo mapping competition. Attendees of this mapathon will get 
training on what is mapping, how can you map and how to be a part of the global humanitarian community. 
There will be a mapping competition afterwards and the winners/runner ups will be awarded with prizes. 
All of the participating students will get certificates. The certificates and prizes are sponsored by the Geographical Society at FCC.
