In celebration of National GIS Day and National Geography Awareness Week, 
the Macalester College Geography Department will be once again hosting a Humanitarian Mapathon on November 16th! 
NO GEOGRAPHY OR MAPPING EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. We'll teach you how to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) to trace roads and 
buildings for humanitarian and disaster relief efforts using satellite imagery. Then we'll all work as one big 
team to map as much as we can during the evening. We'll have some computers, but you can also bring your laptop and charger 
(there'll be plenty of space!). There will be music playing, there will be snacks; the more people who come, the more we can accomplish!
