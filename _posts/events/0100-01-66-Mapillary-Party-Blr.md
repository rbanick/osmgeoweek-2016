Join us to learn about the Mapillary service for crowd sourcing street level imagery, 
and techniques for deriving and adding rich map data to OpenStreetMap. 
This is a hands-on workshop for anyone interested in open data, OpenStreetMap, 
or developing tools in the field of image detection and feature extraction.
