Join us for a humanitarian map-a-thon hosted by the CWU Geography Department in Dean Hall 206. 
Learn to trace objects from detailed satellite imagery to fill in undermapped areas, placing the 
data into a free online map of the world called OpenStreetMap. 

No previous experience with mapping technologies is necessary; a short training will be held during 
the first 20 minutes to aid beginners, but you are invited to come anytime during the event
