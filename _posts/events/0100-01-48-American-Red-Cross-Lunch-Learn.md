Please join us for a Lunch and Learn mapping event! In honor of GeoWeek, we will be hosting a Missing Maps mapathon with guest speakers from partnering humanitarian organizations.  OSM GeoWeek calls on teachers, students, community groups, governments, private sector organizations, and map-lovers around the world to come together to celebrate geography and make maps with OpenStreetMap, the free and openly editable map of the world. The purpose of this event is to actively contribute to humanitarian projects using OpenStreetMap.
